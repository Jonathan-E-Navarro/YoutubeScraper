# YoutubeScraper
A Youtube data scraper I created to get acquainted with the Youtube API  

An application that uses Youtube's API to allow the user to make Youtube queries. Each query returns the title of either channels, or videos pertaining to the query made, as well as other information such as the thumbnail url, id and description.
